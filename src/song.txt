Don't you notice how 😶
I get quiet when there's no one else around? 🤫
Me and you and awkward silence 😬
Don't you dare look at me that way 👀
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same 💔

Oh, the burning pain 🔥
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate 💭
"She's so perfect," blah, blah, blah 🙄
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day 🌅
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say 💌

That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through 💘
And shoots an arrow through my heart 💘🏹
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too? 🤪❤️
Confess I loved you from the start 💞

What's a girl to do? 🤷‍♀️
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue 🛏️💭
Unrequited, terrifying 😔
Love is driving me a bit insane 😵‍💫
Have to get this off my chest 💬
I'm telling you today 🗣️

That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through 💘
And shoots an arrow through my heart 💘🏹
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too? 🤪❤️
Confess I loved you from the start 💞
Confess I loved you 💖
Just thinking of you 💭
I know I've loved you from the start 💗

[Tagalog Version]
Hindi mo ba napapansin kung paano
Tahimik ako kapag walang tao?
Ako at ikaw at ang awkward na katahimikan
Huwag kang maglakas-loob na tumingin sa akin ng ganyan
Hindi ko kailangan ng mga paalala kung paano hindi pareho ang nararamdaman mo
Oh, ang sakit na parang apoy,
Habang kinukwento mo ang bago mong iniibig,
“Ang perpekto niya,” sabi mo pa.
Sana isang araw, magising ka,
Tumakbo sa akin at aminin mong ako pala.
Tuwing kausap kita, si Kupido’y dumadaan,
At tinatamaan ang puso kong sugatan.
Alam kong parang baliw pakinggan,
Pero di mo ba nararamdaman?
Inamin ko minahal kita mula sa simula.
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
"She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
